    <div class="flexIntro">
      <p>Although America has come far on LGBTQ+ issues, there is still progress to be made. The basic human right of adequate health care in America is not available to many individuals that identify as LGBTQ+. Recent state legislation and discrimination in medicine has made it increasingly difficult for queer people, especially trans folks to receive proper health care suited to their needs. In order to help make a difference, we can educate ourselves and advocate for the passage of LGBTQ+ health protections. </p>
