            <p>LGBTQ+ people face a myriad of issues due to discrimination in health care. Many individuals that identify in the community feel estranged by healthcare providers and therefore do not seek medical help.</p>
          </div>
      </div>
            <p class = "textIssues">Not only do LGBTQ+ folks hesitate to get physical healthcare, but they also tend to neglect mental healthcare. This is obviously quite detrimental to the collective mental health of the community and is part of the reason why individuals who identify as LGBTQ+ are two to three times more likely to commit suicide.<br></br>Those most impacted by the inequity in health care are trans people and BIPOC. The lack of protections in this country for trans individuals especially trans youth is a troubling issue. Many healthcare providers are uneducated on trans specific health needs. This also goes for BIPOC as many doctors and health workers express implicit bias against people of color.<br></br>As activists, we can strive to make implicit bias training mandatory and work on getting the proper education to healthcare providers so they can better serve the LGBTQ+ and BIPOC communities.</p>
